# Hotkeys

A hotkey is a key combination that users press at runtime to trigger an action. One of the keys is always a modifier key, such as the **Alt** or **Ctrl** key. Developers typically place an ampersand (&) in front of the hotkey letter. Sometimes they use an underscore (_).

```Hotkeys only occur in Non-ABAP development environments.```

Below are guidelines for translating hotkeys. (_These are examples. Adapt them for your language)_

* _Choose the same character as in the source._
* _If the letter for the hotkey is not present in the translation, choose a different letter._
* _Take care not to place the hotkey in front of a very narrow letter or in front of a special character letter._

###### Example:

Source Text | Target Text
----------- | -----------
&Name | _\<example in your language\>_
Viewer Colo&rs | _\<example in your language\>_
Save as &Template | _\<example in your language\>_
Align _Bottom | _\<example in your language\>_
Align _Center | _\<example in your language\>_

```In rare cases, hotkeys may also be represented by a standalone character in the source text. If you encounter such standalone characters, the above instructions may not apply. Please refer to your project-specific instructions, contact your PM, or submit a query in Query Tracker.```
