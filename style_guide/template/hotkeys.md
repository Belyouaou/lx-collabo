# Hotkeys

A hotkey is a key combination that users press at runtime to trigger an action. One of the keys is always a modifier key, such as the Alt or Ctrl key. Developers typically place an ampersand (&) in front of the hotkey letter. Sometimes they use an underscore (_).

    Hotkeys only occur in Non-ABAP development environments.

To translate hotkeys, follow these instructions <may be adapted for your language>:

* Choose the same character as in the source.
* If the letter for the hotkey is not present in the translation, choose a different letter.
* Take care not to place the hotkey in front of a very narrow letter or in front of a special character letter.

See the following examples:

Source Text | Target Text
----------- | -----------
&Name | \<example in your language\>
Viewer Colo&rs | \<example in your language\>
Save as &Template | \<example in your language\>
Align _Bottom | \<example in your language\>
Align _Center | \<example in your language\>

    In rare cases, hotkeys may also be represented by a standalone character in the source text. If you encounter such standalone characters, the above instructions may not apply. Please refer to your project-specific instructions, contact your PM, or submit a query in Query Tracker.
